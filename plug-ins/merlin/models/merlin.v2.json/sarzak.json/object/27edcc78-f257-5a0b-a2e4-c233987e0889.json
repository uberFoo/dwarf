    "description": "An Anchor Point for Lines\n\nThis represents a point on the periphery of a box to which a relationship attaches.\n\nIt's really sort of clever. Once you figure out which edge, you use the `offset` attribute (a float between 0.0 and 1.0) to calculate how far along that line to draw the line.\n\nðŸš§ The offsets are meant to be for the relationship phrase maybe? Drat, I'll have to figure that out.ðŸš§",
