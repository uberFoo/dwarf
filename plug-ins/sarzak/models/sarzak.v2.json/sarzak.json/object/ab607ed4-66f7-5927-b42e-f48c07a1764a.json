    "description": "External Type\n\nThis may literally be anything. It's used during code generation to generate variables names and type names for things that are outside of a modeled domain. For example, a timer would be an external type. The specifics of how it is used is up to the model compiler.\n\nIn grace, the `name` attribute is used during code generation to create variable names by converting it to `snake_case`. When used as a type, it is converted to `UpperCamelCase`.\n\nWe use `path` as the path is a `use` statement.\n\nI'm updating this while trying to use it, so this description is going to be rather incoherent until things settle down.\n\nThe way I'm using this, and hopefully the way that will always accommodate, is as a singleton within a particular function scope. Maybe it's a system-wide singleton? I dunno. But it's a singleton.",
