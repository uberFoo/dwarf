    "description": "A `Binary` relationship, as itâ€™s name implies, is a relationship between\ntwo objects. It consists of two parts, the `Dependent` end of the \nrelationship and the `Independent` end.\n\nThe former is so named because it has the job of formalizing the\nrelationship. It stores a pointer to the independent object as an attribute.\n\nThe latter is aware of the relationship, but it does not store any \ninformation about the relationship. That said, there are means of\ntraversing the relationship from the `Independent` object. ",
