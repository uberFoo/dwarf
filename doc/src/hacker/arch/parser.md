> The problem with parser generators is that you need to understand how a parser works in order to use one.

> The next thing you know parser generators are terrible, evil beasts from the nether depths of the endless turtle Ouroboros.
> You'll write your own, buggy, hard to maintain parser, or you'll learn how the work, and build a well-behaved parser.
