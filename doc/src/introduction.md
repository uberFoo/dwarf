# Introduction

Welcome!
This brief introduction will outline the status of dwarf, and set the stage for what's to come.

## {{i:Hello World}}

Every language deserves one, so let's get it out of the way.
Go ahead and click the run button in the top right corner.

```dwarf, editable
fn main() {
    let name = "World";
    print("Hello " + name + "!");
}
```

Feel free to edit the code â€” replace `World` with your name maybe?
I know you want to. ðŸ˜€

## What is dwarf? Why another language?

dwarf is a type-checked, interpreted language *heavily* influenced by Rust.
I needed it to continue my other project writing code generators.
As the language was coming together it sort of grew a life of it's own.
I decided that it may be generally useful to others, so I decided to open source it.
