# For Hackers

> "The best programmers are not always the most productive. They are the ones who are able to let go of their ego and embrace the Tao. They write code that is simple and elegant, yet powerful and efficient. They understand that the best code is the code that is not written. They know that the best way to solve a problem is to avoid it altogether. They are like water, which flows around obstacles and finds the path of least resistance. They are the masters of their craft, yet they remain humble and open to learning. They are the ones who create software that is a joy to use and a pleasure to maintain."

First off, the code is pretty rough.
I've been hacking on this pretty much non-stop for three months.
And the code generator is still in it's infancy too.
